# Phonology

## Consonants

Kalahim has stops, fricatives, nasals, approximants, and a trill. Stops contrast by voicing, while the fricatives are all voiceless.

|             | labial | dental | palatal | velar | glottal |
|-------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| stop        | p b    | t d    | tʃ dʒ   | k g   |         |
| fricative   | f      | s      | ʃ       |       | h       |
| nasal       | m      | n      |         |       |         |
| approximant | w      | l      | j       |       |         |
| trill       |        | r      |         |       |         |

1. The approximant /w/ is always preceded by a consonant. For example: *amua* /amwa/, *fuanen* /fwanen/. Cf. \*\*/wana/. Historical note: Single onset /w/ was lost everywhere, and the eventual resulting vowel combination became a diphthong or simplified to a simple vowel. Examples: *reik-* 'to turn' /reik/ < \**rewik-*, *yal*- 'to sing' /jal/ < \**yawal-*.

## Vowels

Kalahim has a five-vowel system, with high, mid, and low heights, front, central, and back backness. Note that the mid vowels are both mid-high.

|      | front | central | back |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| high | i     |         | u    |
| mid  | e     |         | o    |
| low  |       | a       |      |

There are also the following diphthongs: /ei/, /eu/, /oi/, /ou/, /ai/, /au/.

## Phonotactics

The basic syllabic structure of Kalahim is C(C)V(C). Onsetless syllables are only permitted in word-initial position. Independent of syllabic affiliation, no more than two consecutive consonants are allowed in any position in the word.
Any consonant, except /tʃ/ and /dʒ/, can be word-final.

Allowed onset clusters:

* pr, pl, pw, pj
* tr, tl, tw, tj
* kr, kl, kw, kj, ks, kʃ
* br, bl, bw, bj
* dr, dl, dw, dj
* gr, gl, gw, gj
* sp, st, sk, sl, sw, sj
* ʃp, ʃt, ʃk, ʃl, ʃw, ʃj
* fl, fr, fw, fj
* hw, hj
* mw, mj
* nw, nj
* rw, rj
* lw, lj

## Stress

Stress is intensive and it falls always on the penultimate syllable of the word in plurisyllabic words, and in the only syllable of monosyllabic words.

Verbs ending in -*u* (/w/) and -*i* (/j/) have -*e* and -*o* for past and future suffixes. Verbs ending in -*i* have -*yly* for hypothetical.

Passive is obtained by adding the suffix *-s* last.

*Doneganiegos nide.*

    donegan-ie-go-s   ni-de
    save-PST-1s-PASS  2s-ABL:SG
    'I was saved by you.'

Present participles are formed with the suffix -*am* which is attached to the verb root and they can be declined according the to consonant declination.

    person-GEN:SG think-PTCP-GEN:SG

### Copula

There are two copulas in Kalahim, *aum-* and *ash-*. The first is used with the predicative case and refers to a permanent or substantial feature of the subject. For example, *om-a-go ned-es* 'I am (a) man'. *ash-* is used with temporary states and feelings, like in *ash-a-lah cul* 'it is sweet'.

| aum-     | past     | present  | future   | hypothetical |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1s      | aum-i-go   | om-a-go    | aum-u-go   | aum-yl-go   |

|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1s      | ash-e-go  | ash-a-go    | ash-o-go  | ash-ily-go   |

| 3sm     | ash-e-lo  | ash-a-lo    | ash-o-lo  | ash-ily-lo   |
| 3sf     | ash-e-re  | ash-a-re    | ash-o-re  | ash-ily-re   |
| 3sn     | ash-e-lah | ash-a-lah   | ash-o-lah | ash-ily-lah  |

| 3pln    | ash-e-sah | ash-a-sah   | ash-o-sah | ash-ily-sah  |

The verb *om*- which means 'to be (locative)' derives from *aum-* although it does not have allomorphy. It is also used at the neuter to mean 'There is/are' (expletive), in which case it is used with the predicative case. *om*- follows the standard verbal conjugation.

*Omago Limlin'ija.*

    om-a-go         Limlin'-ija
    be.PRED-PRS-1s  Limlin-LOC:SG
    'I am in Limlin.'

*Omielah jekines.*

    om-ie-lah       jeki-nes
    be.STA-PST-3sn  monkey-PRED:PL
    'There were (some) monkeys'

### Negation

A verb is negated by placing the negative adverb *an* after the verb.

*Dluntuogo an fladriba.*

  dlunt-uo-go an  fladri-ba
  come-FUT-1s NEG forest-ALL:SG
  'I will not come to the forest.'

## Nouns

Nouns end either in a vowel or a consonant and follow their respective class declension. Archaic forms of suffixes are given in square brackets. The predicative plural ending has two forms, -*nes* and -*nesse* which tend to be respectively the standard in the spoken and written language.

The predicative is used with the verb *aum-* 'to be', which has an existential meaning (while *ash*- is more generally stative).

## Subordination

**Complement clauses** are introduced by the particle *nai*. All complement clauses are finite (they always have a finite verb).

*Kabasiesu nai korashiego.*

    kabas-ie-su   nai korash-ie-go
    know-PST-3plm SUB be.happy-PST-1s
    'They knew I was/have been happy.'

*Tokago nai noirgah-a-go nil.*

    tok-a-go    nai sibu-a-go   ni-l
    want-PRS-1s SUB meet-PRS-1s 2s-ACC:SG
    'I want to meet you.'

Subject complement clauses are preceded by an independent clause of the form 'be.PRED + ADJ/PTCP'.

*Omalah pushaitam nai sibuemin.*

    om-a-lah        pushait-am  nai sibu-o-min
    be.PRED-PRS-3sn scare-PTCP  SUB meet-PST-1pl
    'It scares me that we will meet.'

**Adverbial clauses** are introduced by a variety of adverbial subordinating conjunctions.

**Relative clauses** are introduced by *ki* and a resumptive pronoun is used. The resumptive pronoun in the relative clause is in the case and position it would be if the clause were independent. A nominative resumptive pronoun is generally omitted. If the antecedent is the object of the main clause and the subject of the relative close, *ki* and the subject pronoun are omitted and the antecedent is in the nominative case.

*Lonum ki voinalo korashalo.*

    lonu-m  ki  voin-a-lo     korash-a-lo
    boy-PL  REL play-PRS-3sm  be.happy-PRS-3sm
    'The boy who plays is happy.'

*Nem korashielo mol noirgahielo lonu voinielo.*

    nem       korash-ie-lo    mol   noirgah-ie-lo lonu    voin-ie-lo
    yesterday be.hapy-PST-3sm GRND  see-PST-3sm   boy.NOM play-PST-3sm
    'Yesterday he rejoiced in seeing the boy who was playing.'

Cf. with the object complement clause *Nem korashielo mol noirgahielo nai lonu voinielo* 'Yesterday he rejoiced in seeing that the boy was playing.'

*Firkiniego catieru ki noirgahieni laholu.*

    firkin-ie-go  catie-ru        ki  noirgah-ie-ni lah-olu
    speak-PST-1s  person-INST:SG  REL see-PST-2s    3sn-ACC:SG
    'I spoke with the person you saw.'

*Noirgahiego catiel ki firkinieni lahur.*

    noirgah-ie-go catie-l       ki  firkin-ie-ni  lah-ur
    see-PST-1s    person-ACC:SG REL speak-PST-2s  3sn-INST:SG
    'I saw the person you spoke to.'

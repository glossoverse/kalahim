    save-PST-1s-PASS  2s-ABL
    'I was saved by you.'

Present participles are formed with the suffix -*am* which is attached to the verb root and they can be declined according the to consonant declination.

    person-GEN:SG think-PTCP-GEN:SG

#### Copula

There are two copulas in Kalahim, *aum-* and *ash-*. The first is used with the predicative case and refers to a permanent or substantial feature of the subject. For example, *om-a-go ned-es* 'I am (a) man'. *ash-* is used with temporary states and feelings, like in *ash-a-lah cul* 'it is sweet'.

| 3pln    | ash-e-sah | ash-a-sah   | ash-o-sah | ash-ily-sah  |

The verb *om*- which means 'to be (locative)' derives from *aum-* although it does not have allomorphy. It is also used at the neuter to mean 'There is/are' (expletive), in which case it is used with the predicative case. *om*- follows the standard verbal conjugation.

* *Om-a-go Limlin'-ija* 'I am in Limlin'
* *Om-ie-lah jeki-nes* 'There were (some) monkeys'

### Noun

Nouns end either in a vowel or a consonant and follow their respective class declension. Archaic forms are given in square brackets. The accusative plural ending has two forms, -*nes* and -*nesse* which tend to be respectively the standard in the spoken and written language.

The predicative is used with the verb *aum-* 'to be', which has an existential meaning (while *ash*- is more generally stative).
